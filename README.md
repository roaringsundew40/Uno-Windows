The Uno Game from my website at www.namankhurana.org
Uno is a famous Card Game from Mattel Games. Players take turns matching a card in their hand with the current card shown on top of the deck either by color or number. If you can’t make a match, you must draw from the central pile! And when you’re down to one card, don’t forget to shout “UNO!”. Read the Rules https://www.mattelgames.com/en-us/cards/uno.
